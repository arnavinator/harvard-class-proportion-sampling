**1)** Not all respondents were asked every question. `r q1` respondents were asked the question about whether the USA should create a gun registry.

**2)**  Of the respondents that got asked all four gun policy questions, `r q2` percent are gun owners. 

**3)** The average “agreement” score (from 1-4) on the statement_gun_rights variable is `r no_gun_agree` for those respondents who live in households without guns, while the average “agreement” score in households with guns is `r gun_own_agree`.

**4)** Another set of questions asks about religion. The first ranked category of religion for the age group of people 18-30 is `r religion_y`. The first-ranked religion category for people 30 and older is `r religion_o`. 

**5)** Lots of people say that the younger generation has the highest percent of “nones;” people who answer “nothing in particular”, when you ask them their religion. In the 18-30 age group, “nothing in particular” is ranked `r young_rank`, while in the 30 and above group, “nothing in particular” is ranked `r old_rank`.

**6)** Consider again the nones (all people who responded “nothing in particular”) when asked about their religion. In this group, the most popular position is to `r nones` that it is more important for the government to control who owns guns than it is for the government to protect the right to own guns. 

## Question 2: Simulations with List Columns

```{r q2, echo = FALSE}
# 2a; makes a draw cards function which can only take numeric and have
# replacement when drawing cards

draw_cards <- function(n) {
   if(!is.numeric(n)) {
    stop('I am so sorry, but this function only works for numeric input!\n',
         'You have provided an object of class: ', class(n)[1])
  }
  sample(x = c("diamonds", "hearts", "spades", "clubs"), 
         size = n,
         replace = TRUE)
}


# 2b; makes a table of 2 cards being drawn 10 times using map

card_table <- tibble(cards = map(1:10, ~ draw_cards(2)))



# 2c; make a new column which checks for hearts or diamonds in the first and
# second col to accordingly mark if the card drawn is red or not.


card_table <- card_table %>% 
  mutate(check_red = map_lgl(map_chr(card_table$cards, 1),
                               ~ ifelse(. %in% c("hearts", "diamonds"), 
                                        TRUE, 
                                        FALSE)

                               ~ ifelse(. %in% c("hearts", "diamonds"), 
                                        TRUE, 
                                        FALSE)
                               )
  )

# we then combine both check_red cols to a matrix, which we turn into a list
# where each item of the list tells if a set of cards are both red, both black,
# or mixed. I convert this list to characters so that we can check if each row
# for sets of cards drawn are (TRUE, TRUE), (FALSE, FALSE), or neither, which
# can identify if cards are both red, both black, or mixed respectively. Now
# that I have a string which describes each pair of cards, I use function
# color_outcome (which is compatabile with map function) so that we can see if
# each pair's description

color_outcome <- function (x) {
  if (all(x == "c(TRUE, TRUE)")) {
    "Both red"
  } else if (all(x == "c(FALSE, FALSE)")) {
      "Both black"
  } else {
      "Mixed"
  }
}

ll <- matrix(c(card_table$check_red, card_table$check_red_2), nrow = 10, byrow = FALSE)
ll <- t(ll)
bb <- split(ll, rep(1:ncol(ll), each = nrow(ll)))
bb <- as.character(bb)

card_table <- card_table %>% 
  mutate(check_combined = map_chr(bb, color_outcome)
  )


# finally, we format our complete table to a gt table, and print it

card_table %>% 
  gt(auto_align = TRUE) %>%

                               ~ ifelse(. %in% c("hearts", "diamonds"), 
                                        TRUE, 
                                        FALSE)
                               ),
         check_red_2 = map_lgl(map_chr(card_table$cards, 2),
                               ~ ifelse(. %in% c("hearts", "diamonds"), 
                                        TRUE, 
                                        FALSE)
                               )
  )

color_outcome <- function (x) {
  if (all(x == "c(TRUE, TRUE)")) {
    "Both red"
  } else if (all(x == "c(FALSE, FALSE)")) {
      "Both black"
  } else {
      "Mixed"
  }
}

ll <- matrix(c(card_table$check_red, card_table$check_red_2), nrow = 1000, byrow = FALSE)
ll <- t(ll)
bb <- split(ll, rep(1:ncol(ll), each = nrow(ll)))
bb <- as.character(bb)

card_table <- card_table %>% 
  mutate(check_combined = map_chr(bb, color_outcome)
  )

# now that we have the simulation for 1000 trials, we find the probability of
# mixed by counting mixed and dividing by 1000 trials

probab <- card_table %>% 
  count(check_combined) %>% 
  filter(check_combined == "Mixed") %>% 
  pull(n)/1000

```

After running 1000 simulations of drawing a pair of cards, the probability of drawing a red card and black card (a mixed pair), is `r probab * 100` percent.


## Question 3: Modeling a Study Population

```{r q3, echo = FALSE}

# made a tibble which had an id col and using rep a grade col. Then I made a
# percent proportion of students per grade col and rounded the prop to 2 decimal
# places. Finally, in the ggplot, I used a paste to label each bar with a
# percent number and the "%" sign, used vjust to make sure labels do not overlap
# the bars, and added a percent to y-axis labels

pop <- tibble(id = c(1:6120),
              grade = c(rep("freshman", 1800),
                        rep("sophomore", 1450),
                        rep("junior", 1570),

                        )
              )

pop_comp <- pop %>%

```


## Question 4: Sampling

```{r q4, echo = FALSE}

# set seed to have data distribution to be similar to Preceptor's. then I made a
# table x which calculates the proportion of freshmen in each sample. Then, I
# plot a histogram with binwidth and boundaries which are easy to read and
# capture the distribution of freshman per sample well.

set.seed(02139) 

x <- rep_sample_n(pop, size = 25, reps = 5000) %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>%  
  summarize(frosh = sum(grade == "freshman")) %>% 
  mutate(prop_frosh = frosh/25)

ggplot(x, aes(x = prop_frosh)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, boundary = .24, color = "white") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0.08, 0.16, 0.24, 0.32, 0.4, 0.48, 0.56, 0.64),
                     labels = c("0.08%", "0.16%", "0.24%", "0.32%", "0.4%", "0.48%", "0.56%", "0.64%")

       subtitle = "Derived from 5000 Virtual Samples of 25 Students",
       x = "Percent of Freshman",
       y = "Number of Samples")

```

## Question 5: Sampling and Sample Size

```{r q5, echo = FALSE}

# creates a named list sizes which displays what size a sample was when
# proportion was calculated to use with map_df

samp_size = c(25,50,100,500)

set.seed(02139)

# use map_df to make a table which samples from pop 5000 times per each size in
# sizes, and labels which size number each rep slice came from. Then, group_by
# size and rep number (w/o grouping many samples are not disjoint) and find the
# proportion of freshman per every rep. calculate prop_frosh with as.numeric
# size since named list sizes had size vales as chr

university <- map_df(sizes,
                     ~ rep_sample_n(pop,
                                    size = .x,
                                    reps = 5000),
                     .id = "size"
                     )  %>% 
  group_by(size, replicate) %>% 
  summarize(frosh = sum(grade == "freshman")) %>%    
  mutate(prop_frosh = frosh/as.numeric(size))


# use ggplot geom_density to graph distribution of percentage of freshman count
# change based on size which was sampled. used factor to relevel size so that
# legend values appear in the value we desire

university$size <- factor(university$size, levels = c("25", "50", "100", "500"))
                    
ggplot(university, aes(x = prop_frosh, fill = size)) +

       subtitle = "Average sampled percentage gets closer to true percentage as sample size increases",
       x = "Proportion of freshmen",
